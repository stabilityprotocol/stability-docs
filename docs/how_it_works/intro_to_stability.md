# Intro to Stability Network 
_Introduction to Stability Network_ 
#  
At Stability Network, we're pioneering the worldâ€™s first tokenless public distributed ledger network, ushering in an era of stable and predictable costs, regulatory clarity, and removal of volatility. Our permissionless platform strikes a balance between flexibility and privacy, empowering businesses to transact and collaborate without constraints while enabling developers and individual users to participate for free.  
  
Our customizable, open-source network brings in a new age of public distributed ledger technology (DLT), seamlessly accommodating both financial and non-financial transactions with equal efficacy. With a tokenless utility-optimized design, we've elevated network efficiency and scalability to unprecedented levels, ready for mass adoption.  
  
The absence of a native cryptocurrency isn't concealed through complex workarounds but is instead hardcoded into the foundational code. On the user interface front, we've streamlined wallet creation and management through built-in composable Single-Sign-On (SSO) and One-Time-Passcode (OTP) integration, eliminating the hassle of multiple usernames and passwords while also supporting existing known web3 wallet providers such as Metamask. Developers are able to choose whether their apps use one or the other, or both as their supported authentication method[s] for their applications.
  
**Our commitment is clear**: we aim to revolutionize both developer and user onboarding experiences, making blockchain technology effortlessly accessible to all.
