# Authentication

Stability has built-in user authentication capabilities eliminating the need for third party IAM (identity-access-management) to be configured and managed. The objective was to simplify application development and streamline user onboarding. 
  
This is accomplished by leveraging elliptic curve cryptography to generate verifiable proofs of identity and authorization through SSO (single-sign-on) of existing accounts, emailed OTP (one-time-passcode), as well as supporting known web3 wallet services such as **[Metamask](https://metamask.io/)**.

## SSO & OTP Integration w/ Magic

Supported platforms include Web, React Native, Flutter, iOS, Android, and Unity.

Supported social providers for SSO include Google, by default.

_Upon request the following can also be made available for SSO: Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, Apple, Discord, GitHub, LinkedIn, Bitbucket, GitLab, and Twitch._
