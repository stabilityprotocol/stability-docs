# Intro to dApps  

## What is a decentralized application?
A decentralized application, also referred to as a dApp, is an application that operates on a decentralized peer-to-peer network and uses a smart contract as its backend. The frontend can be written in any programming language to make calls to its backend.

### Features of decentralized applications:
- **trustless**: no one person or group needs to be in control as smart contracts are guaranteed to execute in a predictable manner 
- **decentralized**: no one person or group can have control, deterring censorship
- **permissionless**: anyone is free to access and use the application
- **transparency**: data stored on the network is publically available and immutable, providing data integrity
- **zero downtime**: the entire network of nodes supports serving up your dApps capabilities

### Features of traditional applications:
- **centralized**: one person or group monitors and controls the application and associated data, can be independently targeted by malicious actors
- **unverifiable**: nothing is verifiable, data is selectively presented by persons or groups controlling the application
- **permissioned**: access and use is restricted per the discretion of central owners


## Components of a dApp
- distributed peer-to-peer network to operate on
- smart contract to define app functionality and serve as the backend
- frontend user interface that connects to the smart contract
- wallet to serve as a user accounts to interact with the app

## Development Process
1. Define the desired purpose and functionality of your dApp  
2. Set up your development environment (i.e. using git, vscode, npm, Node.js, Solidity, and Truffle)  
3. Write your smart contracts (i.e. using Solidity and Truffle)  
4. Test your smart contracts (i.e. using Truffle)  
5. Choose a frontend framework to build the UI/UX (i.e. using React)  
6. Connect frontend and backend (i.e. using web3.js or ethers.js)  
7. Design and develop the UI/UX  
8. Integrate Metamask or Stability SSO to enable user access  
9. Test the dApp on Stability Testnet  
10. Arrange for a third-party audit (i.e. SlowMist or Zellic)  
11. Deploy to Stability Mainnet
12. Monitor and maintain the dApp 
13. Improve the dApp with new features
14. Promote your dApp to your specified target market
