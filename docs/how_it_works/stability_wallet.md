# Stability Wallet

The Stability Wallet is a developer SDK that eliminates the need to remember passwords or seed phrases to interact with a Stability dApp, ultimately streamlining web3 onboarding. This is accomplished by leveraging elliptic curve cryptography to generate verifiable proofs of identity and authorization through SSO (single-sign-on) of existing accounts, emailed OTP (one-time-passcode), as well as supporting the known web3 wallet service **[Metamask](https://metamask.io/)**.

## SSO & OTP Integration

Supported platforms include Web, React Native, Flutter, iOS, Android, and Unity.

Supported server-side SDKs include Node, Python, Laravel, Ruby, PHP, Go, and Wordpress.

Supported social providers for SSO include Google, by default.

_Upon request the following can also be made available for SSO: Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, Apple, Discord, GitHub, LinkedIn, Bitbucket, GitLab, and Twitch._

## Metamask Integration
