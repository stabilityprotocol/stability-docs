## What is a decentralized application?
A decentralized application, also referred to as a dApp, is an application that uses a blockchain as its backend. dApps are permissionless and transparent by nature, whereas traditional applications are centralized and permissioned with limited transparency.

## Components of a dApp
- Blockchain network to operate on
- Smart Contracts to serve as a backend and define app functionality
- Wallets to serve as accounts to interact with app functionality

## Development Process
1. Define the desired purpose and functionality of your dApp
2. Set up your development environment (i.e. using git, vscode, npm, Node.js, Solidity, and Truffle)
3. Write your smart contracts (i.e. using Solidity and Truffle)
4. Test your smart contracts (i.e. using Truffle)
5. Choose a frontend framework to build the UI/UX (i.e. using React)
6. Connect frontend and backend (i.e. using web3.js or ethers.js)
7. Design and develop the UI/UX
8. Integrate Metamask or Stability SSO for user access
9. Test the dApp on Stability Testnet
10. Arrange for a third-party audit (i.e. SlowMist or Zellic)
11. Deploy to Stability Mainnet
12. Monitor and maintain the dApp
13. Improve the dApp with new features
14. and finally, promote your dApp to your specified target market!
