# Log into Stability platforms and applications

Stability platforms and applications support SSO, Emailed OTP, and Metamask for user authentication.

## SSO
By default, Google is an available option for Single-Sign-On.

_Upon request, we can provide support for Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, Apple, Discord, GitHub, LinkedIn, Bitbucket, GitLab, and Twitch._
