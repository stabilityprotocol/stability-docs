# Transactions

## Introduction

One of the standout features of our blockchain platform is the implementation of zero gas price transactions. This approach is part of our commitment to offering an efficient and cost-effective transaction experience. It allows users to execute transactions without the added burden of gas fees, a common expense in many other blockchain environments.

### Free Transactions on Testnet

As part of our dedication to user convenience and platform accessibility, we offer 25 free transactions per day to each user on our Testnet. This daily allowance resets at 00:00 UTC. Users can easily monitor their transaction count and the reset timing by visiting the **[Stability Portal](https://portal.stabilityprotocol.com)** section of our Testnet platform. This feature is ideal for testing and development purposes, providing a risk-free environment to explore the capabilities of our blockchain.

### Mainnet Transactions and API Key Requirement

When operating on the Mainnet, the free transaction policy available on the Testnet does not apply. Users are required to create an API Key through our **[Stability Portal](https://portal.stabilityprotocol.com)** for conducting transactions on the Mainnet. This key is a crucial component for accessing our Mainnet services, enabling users to securely and effectively manage their transactions.
