# Nodes

There are two main node types on the Stability blockchain, validator nodes and fullnodes. Below you will find details about the different types of each.

_Fullnodes (FNs)_ have a consistent view of the Stability ledger with no read rate-limitations

_Validator Fullnodes (VFNs)_ state sync from validator nodes directly

_Public Fullnodes (PFNs)_ state sync with other fullnodes

_Archive Nodes (ANs)_ contain all blockchain data from genesis block, also known as the first block in a blockchains history

_Validator Nodes (VNs)_ run distributed consensus to execute and store transactions on the blockchain and communicate directly with other validator nodes over a private network
