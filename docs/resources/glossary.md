# Glossary  
Terms you should familiarize yourself with.

## A
### account   
the location of which digital assets are stored consisting of a nonce, balance, storageRoot, and codeHash  
### address  
a unique identifier used to send, receive, and store digital assets on a blockchain  
### airdrop  
a method of digital asset distribution to existing token holders  
### API  
an application programming interface that allows you to interact with a blockchain without building a platform  

#

## B
### block  
the place in a blockchain where data (I.e. transaction data) is stored  
### block height  
the number of confirmed blocks from the genesis block to the most recent block  
### block explorer  
a tool that allows you to view historical and real-time activity on a blockchain  
### block time  
the time it takes for a Validator or Miner to verify a transaction within one block and produce another block  
### blockchain  
a decentralized, digital ledger that is distributed among nodes of a peer-to-peer network  

#

## C
### consensus  
a mechanism that validates a transaction, reaching consensus is an integral part of how transactions are processed  
### cryptocurrency  
a digital currency created using encryption algorithms  
### cryptography  
cryptographic techniques that allow cryptocurrency transactions to be secure, trustless, and pseudonymous  

#

## D
### dapp  
a decentralized application that runs on a blockchain instead of on a single compute and storage instance  
### decentralization  
the transfer of control from a centralized entity to a distributed network  
### distributed ledger  
a database upheld by multiple nodes in a network that are independently managed and synchronized  
### DNT  
is the abbreviation for “Decentralized Native Token and is the Stability Network feature that enables users to select their own token to pay to transact on the blockchain  

#

## E
### epoch  
a unit of time for a certain number of blocks to be completed on a blockchain, this varies per blockchain  
### ERC  
is the abbreviation for “ Ethereum Request for Comment” and is the set of technical standards that are used on the Ethereum blockchain  
### EVM  
is the abbreviation for “Ethereum Virtual Machine” and is the run-time environment contained within the client software needed to run a node on Ethereum, which subsequently manifests the state of the blockchain and enables smart contract functionality  

# 

## F
### faucet  
a developer tool that provides Testnet tokens to anyone that requests them for free, these tokens are then used to test deploying smart contracts and/or sending transactions before deploying a decentralized application (dapp) to Mainnet  
### finality  
is the state of which a transaction on a blockchain is considered immutable, and cannot be reverted  

#

## G
### gas  
a fee that users pay to process a transaction or use smart contracts on a blockchain network that is typically the native token for the blockchain you are transacting on, on the Stability Network gas fees are optional due to the existence of a feature called “Zero Gas Transactions” and you can bring-your-own-token since Stability Network does not have its own native token due to the existence of a feature called “Decentralized Native Token”  

#

## H
### hash  
a cryptographic function that converts an input of any length to a unique output of a fixed length  

#

## I
### immutability  
the ability to be permanent and unalterable  

#

## J
### JSON-RPC  
enables communication between blockchain nodes and client applications, such as retrieving information or sending transactions  

#

## L
### Layer 1  
a base blockchain of which secondary blockchains and/or applications can be built on top of, the two biggest L1 blockchains are Bitcoin and Ethereum  
### Layer 2  
a secondary blockchain or other technology built on top of a Layer 1 network, typically made in efforts to optimize Layer 1 capabilities and use   

#

## M
### mainnet  
the main version of a working and fully operational blockchain protocol  
### mempool  
a list of transactions waiting to be validated by a node before being committed to a block on a blockchain, can also be referred to as a memory pool  

#

## N
### node  
a network stakeholder that runs the protocol software of a decentralized blockchain network, is responsible for maintaining a distributed ledger and serve as a communication hub  

#

## O
### offchain  
transactions that occur outside of a blockchain but can be later integrated with onchain data  
### onchain  
transactions that occur on a blockchain and are reflected on a distributed ledger  
### oracle  
an entity that connects onchain and offchain data  

#

## P
### P2P  
a type of decentralized network architecture that allows nodes to share resources without going through a central authority or intermediary  
### PoA  
stands for Proof-of-Authority, is a consensus algorithm that allows a defined/authorized number of actors the ability to validate transactions and interact with the network  
### protocol  
a set of guidelines that enables data to be shared between systems and/or networks  

#

## R
### rust  
a systems programming language that has gained popularity for its performance, reliability, and security   

#

## S
### smart contracts  
self-executing programs stored on a blockchain that run when defined conditions are met, automating agreements  
### solidity  
an object-oriented programming language that is used to implement smart contracts on various blockchains, such as Ethereum  
### stablecoin  
a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset class, created in an attempt to have a more stable value  
### state  
a large data structure that hold accounts, balances, machine status  

#

## T
### testnet  
the test version of a working and fully operational blockchain protocol  
### token  
an asset that is digitally transferable  
### transaction  
a transmission of data across a distributed network, includes purchasing, selling, transferring, and more

#

## V
### validator  
a participant/stakeholder in a blockchain network that is responsible for validating transactions and maintaining the integrity and consensus of a blockchain network  

#

## W
### wallet  
a digital wallet used to store and manage digital assets, where a public key is similar to an account number  
### Web2  
the second and current generation of internet that introduced interactive functionality and is mostly centralized and permissioned   
### Web3  
the third generation of internet that introduces decentralization and permissionless systems  

#

## Z
### ZGT  
is the abbreviation for “Zero Gas Transactions and is the Stability Network feature that makes transaction fees optional on the blockchain, making blockchain technology more accessible by removing the financial risk
