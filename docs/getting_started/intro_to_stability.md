# Intro to Stability  
_Introduction to Stability Network_ 
#  
At Stability Network, we're pioneering the worldâ€™s first tokenless public distributed ledger network, ushering in an era of stable and predictable costs, regulatory clarity, and removal of volatility. Our permissionless platform strikes a balance between flexibility and privacy, empowering businesses to transact and collaborate without constraints while enabling individual users to participate for free.  
  
Our customizable, open-source network brings in a new age of public distributed ledger technology (DLT), seamlessly accommodating both financial and non-financial transactions with equal efficacy. With a tokenless utility-optimized design, we've elevated network efficiency and scalability to unprecedented levels, ready for mass adoption.  
  
The absence of a native cryptocurrency isn't concealed through complex workarounds but is instead hardcoded into the foundational code. On the user interface front, we've streamlined wallet creation and management through composable Single-Sign-On (SSO) integration, eliminating the hassle of multiple usernames and passwords.  
  
Our commitment is clear: we aim to revolutionize both developer and user onboarding experiences, making blockchain technology effortlessly accessible to all.
