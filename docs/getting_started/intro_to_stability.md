# Intro to Stability

Stability Network - as the worldâ€™s first tokenless public distributed ledger network - ushers in an era of stable and predictable costs, regulatory clarity, and removal of volatility. Our permissionless platform is flexible enough to still preserve privacy thereby empowering businesses to transact and collaborate without restrictions, and enables individual users to participate for free. Notably, the absence of a native cryptocurrency is not abstracted away through highly complex, unsustainable workarounds, but hardcoded into the base layer code.

Our customizable, flexible, open-source network brings in a new age of public distributed ledger technology (DLT) that stands ready to accommodate both financial and non-financial transactions with equal efficacy. Our tokenless utility-optimized design amplifies network efficiency and scalability to unprecedented heights, prepared for mass adoption. Stability provides a simple and intuitive platform that is accessible to anyone, for the purpose of unlocking a powerful tool for businesses and people to build their own success.
