# Stability Concepts

## Zero Gas Transactions (ZGT)

_Zero Gas Transactions (ZGT)_ empower validators to process transactions integrated into the blockchain at zero cost. These transactions are not part of the public mempool. Instead, they are added to the validator mempool via an external service, which is responsible for implementing the necessary filters or rules to validate the transactions.

## Business Share Revenue (BSR)

_Business Share Revenue_ allows for the option of having transaction fees be split between validators and dApps, providing a financial incentive for developers to build and maintain applications on Stability Chain.
