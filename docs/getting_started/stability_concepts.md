# Stability Concepts
Zero Gas Transactions, Business Share Revenue, Decentralized Native Token, and Sponsored Transactions overview.
## Zero Gas Transactions (ZGT)

_Zero Gas Transactions (ZGT)_ empower validators to process transactions integrated into the blockchain at zero cost. These transactions are not part of the public mempool. Instead, they are added to the validator mempool via an external service, which is responsible for implementing the necessary filters or rules to validate the transactions.

## Business Share Revenue (BSR)

_Business Share Revenue_ allows developers to claim rewards through setting transaction fees to interact with their dApps. This provides a financial incentive to build and maintain applications on Stability Network. Transaction fees are shared between validators and dApps. 

## Decentralized Native Token (DNT)

_Decentralized Native Token_ replaces traditional use of a chain-specific native gas token, allowing users and validators the autonomy and flexibility to select a token of their choosing for transaction processing. The list of available tokens is maintained by a public whitelist contract maintained by network validators.

## Sponsored Transactions 

_Sponsored Transactions_ allows for a third-party to pay the fees of a standard transactions, in the event that Zero-Gas-Transactions (ZGT) is not used. This could be used to implement a free trial/freemium access to dApps for new end-users, among other promotional use cases to streamline user onboarding and not require having a funded account/wallet to use the dApp
