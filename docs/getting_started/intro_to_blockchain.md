# Intro To Blockchain

A blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger distributed among nodes of a peer-to-peer network that can store data of any kind, similar to a conventional database. The difference however, is that storage is not centralized and stored in one location, which has the risk of being a single point of failure.

This digital ledger is commonly referenced as a chain that is made up of incremental blocks of data. As new data is added to the peer-to-peer network, a new block is created and attached to the chain by validators. These validators must verify and confirm the legitimacy of the data using cryptography to reach consensus.

Cryptocurrency is one of the most common uses of blockchain technology today, where purchases, sales, exchanges, and spend is recorded as transactions on a blockchain. Although this use case has gained popularity, it has also caused unnecessary monetization and subsequent governance and regulation, as every action on-chain is a financial transaction.

The Stability team has shifted this paradigm of blockchain technology by making financial transactions optional, and bringing focus more to utility as opposed to monetization of transactions and micro-transactions. Further democratizing access to the most transformational technology of the digital age.
